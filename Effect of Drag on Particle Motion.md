Effect of Drag on Particle Motion

Overview

This paper describes the derivation and application of the effect of drag on the position and velocity of eah particle.

Foundations and Assumptions

Drag is an acceleration due to friction between the particle and the medium that it travels through. The acceleration is in the opposite direction of the motion and is proportional to the speed. Drag is defined by the following equation:

    D = Cd * r * s^2 * A / 2

where
    Cd is the "coefficient of drag"
    r is the density of the medium
    s is the speed of the particle
    A is the equivalent area of the particle 

The equation is simplified by assuming that Cd, r, and A are constant and can be combined into a single constant:

    c = Cd * r * A / 2

This gives:

    D = c * v^2
